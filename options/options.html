        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p class="q"><strong>Q: Why did you build this app?</strong></p>
        <p>Have you ever tried to quit Facebook or Twitter, but found yourself constantly going to it, like a reflex? This application removes that temptation and shows you a cute cat video instead.</p>
        <p class="q"><strong>Q: I get a weird "this app failed to redirect to <em>site</em> because SOME OTHER APP redirected to SOME OTHER SITE" error</strong></p>
        <p>This means you probably have another extension that is conflicting with Cats Help You Quit Social.</p>
        <p>Look in your extensions for other apps that redirect you to other sites. For example, if you have <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=nl">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, you will see this error, because HTTP Everywhere will attempt to redirect you as well.</p>
        <p>You can either ignore the error, or remove the other extension that conflicts with this one.</p>
        <p class="q"><strong>Q: I get the same cat videos every time...</strong></p>
        <p>Yeah, right now we are keeping the number of videos we redirect users to fairly small to ensure they're good cat videos that we're redirecting people to. We will add more videos to our repertoire in the future!</p>
        <p class="q"><strong>Q: I wish there was a way to pause the extension so I can go check social!</strong></p>
        <p>We wouldn't be doing our job very well if we let you do that, now would we? ;)</p>
